## Getting Started

First, create a `.env.local` file in the root folder with given environment variables, you can get them in the setting of chat2query in TiDBCloud's web console:

```env
TIDBCLOUD_URL=https://data.tidbcloud.com/api/v1beta/apps/[YOUR_DATAAPI_ENDPOINT]/v1/chat2chart
TIDBCLOUD_API_KEY=YOUR_DATA_API_KEY
TIDBCLOUD_DB=YOUR_DATABASE_NAME
TIDBCLOUD_CLUSTER_ID=YOUR_CLUSTER_ID
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or preferred
pnpm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Basic Auth

If you want to deploy your own clone and also protect the page from being visited by the public, we also provided a simple basic access authentication solution. You'll need to add two more environment variables in your `.env.local` and the Vercel dashboard. Don't use a simple passphrase like below, replace `admin` with your own one: 

```env
BASIC_AUTH_USER=admin
BASIC_AUTH_PASSPHRASE=admin
```

Then re-deploy, all your pages will be protected, and they can only be accessed with correct user and passphrase!
